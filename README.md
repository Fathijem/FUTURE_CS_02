# SOC Alert & Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow using **Splunk** to detect and visualize suspicious activities such as:
- After-hours logins
- Internal & external connection attempts
- Malware detection (Trojan, Rootkit, Spyware, Ransomware, Worm)
- File access from unusual IPs

The goal is to:
- Parse logs and extract security-relevant fields
- Create targeted alerts
- Classify incidents by severity
- Visualize activity in a Splunk dashboard
